## Epics and User Stories
 ### Epic
  A game in which the player controls a square with their mouse and tries to escape from a chasing enemy square.
 ### User Stories   
 #### Enemy   
 The game should have an enemy which is able to chase the player, the game should be able to detect when the enemy touches the player so that they can lose lives.
 #### Player   
 The player should be able to control their square by using a mouse, this should be responsive and accurate to ensure the game is playable.
 #### Lives   
 The player should be able to lose lives whenever they are touched by the enemy square, if they are touched 3 times they lose the game.
 #### Game area   
 The game should be set on a specific size of game canvas; this will ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent.
 ### Non-functional Requirements   
 #### Graphics   
 The game should have some graphics, so that the enemy and the player are distinguishable and so the game has a degree of visual appeal.
 #### Restart   
 When the player loses all of their lives, the game should be able to restart. 
 #### Invulnerability   
 When the player is touched by the enemy, there should be a short period of time where the player cannot be damaged again. This is in order to prevent the player from losing very quickly from multiple touches.
